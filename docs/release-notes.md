# Release Notes

## [v1.90.0] - 2026-01-31

### New Features

- **Namespace Operations**: Added support for starting, stopping, and restarting namespaces via CLI (`namespace` command), TUI (new namespace modal), and REST API.
- **Enhanced Port Monitoring**: Added UDP port detection and child process listener detection, so processes that spawn worker children (e.g., uvicorn, npm) now correctly report all open ports, by Jesse Dhillon.
- **Interactive Process Scrolling**: Added scrollback support for interactive processes with mouse wheel and keyboard navigation (`Ctrl+A` followed by arrow keys).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `PC_ADDRESS` environment variable not being read correctly, by Lazar Bodor.
- Improved Windows process stopping by dynamically building taskkill arguments and gracefully handling process not found errors.

### Maintenance

- **Testing**: Improved test reliability and cross-platform compatibility, particularly for Windows.
- **CI/CD**: Added `clean-testrace` target to Makefile.
